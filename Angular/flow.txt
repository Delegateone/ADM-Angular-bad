Angular flow

==> index.html, reads custom sector name
==> then loads main.ts file from src folder
==> then bootstrap a module name . i.e bootstrapModule(AppModule)
    AppModule is aviable in src/app/app.mudule.ts file
==> in app.module.ts file @NgModule bootstraps a componet in bootstrap 
    section i.e bootstrap: [AppComponent]
    AppComponent is a type script class which is aviable under src/app/app.component.ts file
==> in AppComponent class, @Component decarator, reads sector name. 
   what is a selector?
   ------------------
   wheere ever placing name of sector, corresponding htmlTemple template replaces




   cli commands to create component

   ng generate component greet

   notes: do not add any components keywords for the newly creating component
   ex: ng generate component greetcomponent is wrong
   ng generate component greetcomponent internally creates component name as
   class name as GreetComponentComponent
